## About
More and skaters are picking up a bike and start cycling. This site will attempt to feature pro skaters and people involved in the skate industry about their cycling adventures.

Obviously, the name is a play on [Skate or Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skate_or_Die!), one of the earlier skateboard video games and a term widly used in todays society.

In February 2015, [Cadence Collection](http://www.cadencecollection.com/) took a bunch of pro skaters to Nicaragua for a skate and bike trip. Rob Gonzales, one of the guys on the trip, started using [#skateorbike](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/skateorbike/) on instagram to document their adventure.
